# PlayCast

PlayCast is a football analytics framework for match modeling using deep learning and probabilistic methods. It applies Monte Carlo simulations to represent match dynamics and estimate outcome distributions across different temporal horizons.

## Overview

The project focuses on learning match-level behavior from historical and event-based data. Models are designed to capture temporal structure, uncertainty, and non-linear interactions between teams, players, and game states.

PlayCast is intended as a research-oriented codebase for experimentation with predictive models, simulations, and evaluation methodologies in football analytics.

## Core Concepts

- Match state representation and temporal modeling  
- Deep learning architectures for sequential data  
- Probabilistic outcome estimation  
- Monte Carlo simulation of match evolution  

## Status

Early-stage development. APIs, models, and data interfaces are subject to change.
